Starting from v1.292, use "sdm.xml" instead of "dto.xml".

How to migrate:

1. click "Create/Overwrite XSD files"
2. click "Create sdm.xml"
3. copy-paste internal text from "dto.xml":<dto-classes>... to "sdm.xml":<sdm>...
4. delete "dto.xml" and "dto.xsd"
5. click "Validate Configuration" -> done.

Where to declare DAO classes with v1.292+:

- "option 1": separate XML files like in prev. versions
- "option 2": tags "<dao-class..." in "sdm.xml"

Once you start using "option 2", "option 1" is ignored.
