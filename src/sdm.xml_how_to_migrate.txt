Starting from v1.292, use "sdm.xml" instead of "dto.xml".

How to migrate:

1. click "Create/Overwrite XSD files"
2. click "Create sdm.xml"
3. copy-paste internal text from "dto.xml":<dto-classes>... to "sdm.xml":<sdm>...
4. delete "dto.xml" and "dto.xsd"
5. click "Validate Configuration" -> done.

Where to declare DAO classes:

- inline tags "<dao-class..." in "sdm.xml"
- external XML files + registering in "sdm.xml" with "<dao-class ref="..."
